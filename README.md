# python_security_system

This project was made as a fast and easy approach at creating a surveillance system using just a Raspberry Pi and an Pi Camera.

Common coding guidelines may not have been followed and system security is not a priority (unencrypted password specified in code and put in memory).

Some tutorials followed are linked in the files.
